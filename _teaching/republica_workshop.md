The debate on balancing free speech and content moderation is more urgent than ever. I, as part of the TUM Content Moderation Lab, in collaboration with Das NETTZ, presented data from 10 democracies on this question and more. In the workshop, participants explored culturally sensitive, real-world solutions.
