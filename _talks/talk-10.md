Invited talk in Prof. Holli A. Semetko’s course “Media, Technology and Politics in Comparative Perspective” at Emory University.
The talk primarily focused on my co-authorerd research verified individuals who reported potentially illegal content in Germany -- examining how they differ from the general population in demographics, political profiles and attitudes, social media experiences, and looking at their motivations to report. 
A brief U.S. -- Germany comparison was included to contextualize how the German setting differs from the U.S.
