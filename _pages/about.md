# About


I am a third-year doctoral candidate and research associate at the [Chair of Digital Governance](https://www.hfp.tum.de/en/digitalgovernance/home/){:target="_blank"} at the Technical University of Munich. I am mainly employed in the project "[Transparency in Content Moderation](https://www.tum.de/en/news-and-events/all-news/press-releases/details/analyse-des-verhaltens-von-social-media-plattformen){:target="_blank"}" project. 

I'm further involved in the newly established Content Moderation Lab as a member and research collaborator, incubated at the TUM Think Tank ([see more](https://tumthinktank.de/project/content-moderation-lab/){:target="_blank"}).
