# About


I am a second-year doctoral candidate and research associate at the [Chair of Digital Governance](https://www.hfp.tum.de/en/digitalgovernance/home/){:target="_blank"} at the Technical University of Munich. I am mainly employed in the project "[Transparency in Content Moderation](https://www.tum.de/en/news-and-events/all-news/press-releases/details/analyse-des-verhaltens-von-social-media-plattformen){:target="_blank"}" project. This project is based at the Technical University of Munich and the University of Konstanz and is funded by the Max Planck-Humboldt Research Award 2022, received by Prof. Margaret E. Roberts (UC San Diego). It is conducted in collaboration with Profs. Yannis Theocharis (Technical University of Munich, Germany) annd Nils Weidmann (University of Konstanz). 

I'm further involved in the newly established Content Moderation Lab as a member and research collaborator, incubated at the TUM Think Tank ([see more](https://tumthinktank.de/project/content-moderation-lab/){:target="_blank"}).
