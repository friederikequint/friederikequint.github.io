# About

I am a doctoral researcher studying how online platforms govern speech — and how users perceive, interpret, and respond to content moderation decisions within broader, evolving patterns of social media use.

I am a third-year PhD candidate and research associate at the [Chair of Digital Governance](https://www.hfp.tum.de/en/digitalgovernance/home/){:target="_blank"} at the Technical University of Munich. My work is primarily situated within the project *[Transparency in Content Moderation](https://www.tum.de/en/news-and-events/all-news/press-releases/details/analyse-des-verhaltens-von-social-media-plattformen){:target="_blank"}*, where I examine how moderation rules are designed, communicated, and understood in practice.

Beyond this project, I am involved as a research collaborator in the Content Moderation Lab, incubated at the TUM Think Tank ([see more](https://tumthinktank.de/project/content-moderation-lab/){:target="_blank"}). The lab brings together academic research and policy-relevant work on platform governance, with a focus on translating empirical findings into practical insights.

Across projects, my research combines survey experiments, observational data, and causal inference approaches, complemented by computational analyses, to better understand patterns of platform use and the social and political implications of content moderation systems.

Alongside my academic work, I occasionally explore smaller, experimental side projects at the intersection of research, design, and tooling.  
A small sneak peek is available here: [**Projects for Fun**](/projectsforfun/).
