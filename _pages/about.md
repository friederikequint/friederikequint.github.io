# About


I am a second-year doctoral candidate and research associate at the [Chair of Digital Governance](https://www.hfp.tum.de/en/digitalgovernance/home/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} at the Technical University of Munich. I am mainly employed in the project "[Transparency in Content Moderation](https://www.tum.de/en/news-and-events/all-news/press-releases/details/analyse-des-verhaltens-von-social-media-plattformen){:target="_blank"}" project. This project is based at the Technical University of Munich and the University of Konstanz and is funded by the Max Planck-Humboldt Research Award 2022, received by Prof. Margaret E. Roberts (UC San Diego). It is conducted in collaboration with Prof. Yannis Theocharis (Technical University of Munich, Germany), Prof. Nils Weidmann and Mia Nahrgang (University of Konstanz, Germany). I'm further involved in the newly established Content Moderation Lab as a member and research collaborator, incubated at the TUM Think Tank ([see more](https://tumthinktank.de/project/content-moderation-lab/){:target="_blank"}).


I received my M.A. degree in Political Science at the University of Mannheim, which included a semester abroad at Aarhus University, Denmark. During my master's studies, I worked as a research assistant at the Chair of Empirical Democracy Research at the University of Mannheim. During my B.A. degree in Political Science at the University of Mannheim, I worked as a research assistant at GESIS (Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences) in Survey Design and Methodology.
