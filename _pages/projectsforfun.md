# Projects for Fun

🚧 **Under Construction** 🚧  

This page will host a small collection of exploratory side projects developed alongside my academic work.

At present, the content is *in preparation*.  
More precisely: ideas exist, drafts exist, and code exists — though not yet in a configuration that can be responsibly documented.

Please consider this page a **preliminary placeholder**.  
Updates will be released once the projects move from “interesting in theory” to “functional in practice.”

_(Status: ongoing. Confidence: cautiously optimistic.)_
